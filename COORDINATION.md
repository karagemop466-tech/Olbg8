# Coordination

Last updated: 2026-10-26 UTC. This board records work across the repository and the source-first primary site on `arena/40c30722-olbg8`.

## Task board

| Task | Status | Owner | File scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| Raw-source fetch workflow and sport-ID probe | done | `arena-f68c2262` | `.github/workflows/fetch-raw.yml`, `.gitignore` |
| Audited static dashboard, source ledger, pricing playbook, tests, integration and publication | done | `53f44a7c` | `README.md`, `index.html`, `review.html`, `methodology.html`, `sports/*.html`, `assets/*`, `data/events.json`, `data/sports.json`, `scripts/build.py`, `scripts/check.py`, `.github/workflows/quality.yml` |
| Verified facts and written predictions | needs review | unassigned | Future `content/predictions/*`; blocked until official facts and current odds are confirmed |

## Session log

- 2026-10-26 — Session `53f44a7c` started from commit `797e50d`, where only `README.md` existed, created a coordination claim, and pushed it immediately on the Arena-fixed branch `arena/53f44a7c-olbg8`.
- 2026-10-26 — Session `arena-f68c2262` independently started from the same empty state and later merged PR #1 to `main`. Its probe established IDs: Tennis 3, Basketball 4, Golf 5, Cricket 7, Snooker 8, Rugby Union 9, Rugby League 10, Baseball 12, Ice Hockey 13, Motor Racing 14, Darts 15, Handball 20, Volleyball 21, Gaelic Football 25, Hurling 26, Greyhounds 28. OLBG has no standalone “Gaelic Sports” category; coverage requires Gaelic Football plus Hurling.
- 2026-10-26 — During final integration, PR #3 detected the simultaneous-session conflict in this file. Session `53f44a7c` merged `origin/main`, preserved the raw-fetch workflow and ID findings from PR #1, corrected its category links, and replaced the conflict markers with this combined record. No other session's files were discarded.

## Completion record

- Built an 18-page static dashboard: executive summary, 15 sport pages, pricing playbook, and Flagged for Review.
- Sources checked: OLBG category and event pages linked in `data/sports.json` and `data/events.json`. These checks establish only what OLBG displayed at snapshot time; OLBG is not an official sports governing source.
- Verification performed: all 22 captured rows retain a direct OLBG event URL; required fields, source domain, all 15 categories, 18 generated pages, and local links pass `python scripts/check.py`. A clean rebuild is enforced in GitHub Actions.
- Irregularities: official event/lineup/injury/stat sources and current offered odds were not available for complete line-by-line confirmation. No original odds, confidence labels, or written predictions were fabricated. All rows are clearly flagged, and missing values remain blank. Several sports had fewer than five discoverable listings; Snooker showed no tips at capture time. OLBG-relative time labels and unusual handball tie selections also require review.
- Publication: PR <https://github.com/karagemop466-tech/Olbg8/pull/3> targets `main`. GitHub Pages is configured at <https://karagemop466-tech.github.io/Olbg8/>. Merge and deployment status are reported in the final session response.

## Supplementary session arena-352da32b (parallel integration)

# Coordination

Session: arena-352da32b. Required session branch: `arena/352da32b-olbg8` (platform restriction overrides requested session branch naming).

| Task | Status | Owner | File scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| Audit sources, build evidence-first dashboard and pricing specifications, integrate and deploy | in progress | arena-352da32b | COORDINATION.md, README.md, index.html, assets/, data/, scripts/, .github/ |

## Log
- 2026-10-26: Repository inspected: only README.md; no existing application, data, or task claims. Claiming initial integration scope. No other session claims found. Will not represent inaccessible sources as checked or manufacture fixtures/picks.
- 2026-10-26: Built 20 static pages and transcribed 75 partial OLBG event observations across 15 sports (Snooker excerpt empty; Gaelic includes Hurling). Sources and exact limitations: data/SOURCES.md. Checked official MLB, ICC, F1 fixture information; ATP, NBA and PDC extraction limitations recorded. Every research row links to an observed OLBG event URL. Missing official facts/odds/lines/predictions remain null. Row-level issues published on Flagged for Review.
- Verification: Python build succeeds; 3 automated tests pass covering internal links across 20 pages, row source/identity/null-prediction constraints, odds/EV/push arithmetic. Python compilation succeeds. External event HTTP status not exhaustively checked. No full completeness claim, fitted pricing engines or completed daily prediction quota. These are needs-review items, not hidden completion claims.
- Automation: dependency-free daily public-link discovery saves unverified artifacts; does not auto-promote facts or fabricate predictions. Static snapshot is not a live feed. Main Pages workflow builds/tests before deploying.
- Integration conflict avoidance: remote main advanced with sessions arena-f68c2262 and 53f44a7c after initial claim. Their root site and build tooling are now owned/published. Relocated this session's work to `research-desk/` (all files beneath it) plus own workflows pages.yml/discovery.yml. Their root assets/data/scripts and README will be preserved on integration. Request to root-site owner: optionally link `research-desk/index.html` as expanded evidence inventory. Permission to switch Pages to Actions returned HTTP 403, so retain legacy main/root publication and check generated supplementary HTML into research-desk/.
- Resolved merge conflicts (COORDINATION.md, .gitignore and README.md): retained remote board and README, appended this session's record, combined ignores. Other sessions' root site/data/assets/scripts preserved byte-for-byte. Own expanded inventory published only beneath research-desk/. Root quality rebuild/check passes unchanged (18 pages/22 listings); supplementary build/check passes (20 pages/75 listings). Relative navigation back to main dashboard included.
- Supplementary scope status: done (dashboard, audit, arithmetic and daily discovery). Prediction production, exhaustive inventories and fitted engines: needs review, explicitly published on research-desk/review.html. No claim of task-complete sports prediction coverage.
- PR: https://github.com/karagemop466-tech/Olbg8/pull/5. Uses existing legacy Pages configuration; attempted Actions configuration update denied HTTP 403, preserved existing main/root source.
- Publication: PR <https://github.com/karagemop466-tech/Olbg8/pull/3> merged successfully to `main` as `f0a3fa9` on 2026-10-26. GitHub Pages deployment run [40396996594](https://github.com/karagemop466-tech/Olbg8/actions/runs/40396996594) completed successfully, and the live site was fetched at <https://karagemop466-tech.github.io/Olbg8/>.

- Preserved concurrent PR #6 publication notes while resolving second coordination-only merge conflict. Initial plain pull --rebase attempted to flatten integration merges; aborted without discarding work and used --rebase=merges for subsequent required pulls.
- Publication confirmed: PR https://github.com/karagemop466-tech/Olbg8/pull/5 merged 2026-10-26T20:38:24Z as e79daa23c77d0f5d243ab1621076fa6cda9bbfb1. Both main quality workflows succeeded. Legacy Pages build/deploy https://github.com/karagemop466-tech/Olbg8/actions/runs/40397439567 succeeded. Live https://karagemop466-tech.github.io/Olbg8/research-desk/ retrieved successfully through page tool; confirms 75 observations, 15 sports, zero published selections and zero operational engines. Root dashboard preserved. Deployment warnings are platform Node 20 deprecation/runner migration notices, not build failures.


## Expanded evidence lab — session 7fbe3ee0

# Coordination

Session: `7fbe3ee0` · Branch: `arena/7fbe3ee0-olbg8` (platform-required; no alternate branch/worktree).

| Task | Status | Owner | File scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| Initial repository and access audit | in progress | 7fbe3ee0 | COORDINATION.md, README.md |
| Source registry, evidence policy, sport pricing research | in progress | 7fbe3ee0 | data/, docs/ |
| Collection, validation, rendering and tests | in progress | 7fbe3ee0 | scripts/, tests/, package.json, package-lock.json, .gitignore |
| Final integration, dashboard and publishing | in progress | 7fbe3ee0 | index.html, assets/, sports/, review/, methodology/, .github/ |

## Log
- 2026-10-26: Repository contains only README.md. No other task claims exist. Session claims the scopes above. All site/navigation integration belongs to this session.
- GitHub Pages is configured to deploy `main` root: https://karagemop466-tech.github.io/Olbg8/ (GitHub Pages API checked).
- Direct HTTPS request to https://www.olbg.com/betting-tips failed with SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL. Restricted outbound hosts may prevent collection; will test available retrieval tools. This is not evidence that OLBG has no events.
- Publication policy: no invented events, lines, statistics, injuries, confidence, predictions, or success claims. Blocked fields stay blank and are flagged; source directory links are not fixture verification.

## Progress — implementation checkpoint
- 2026-10-26, 7fbe3ee0: Initial branch did not exist on origin. First `pull --rebase` of that name failed; rebased on origin/main and immediately pushed the claim to the required session branch. No conflicting work found.
- Source audit: inspected 16 OLBG category pages (15 requested categories, Gaelic Football + Hurling) and primary official destinations for all 15 sports. 116 literal event observations retained. This is a partial extract, not all matches. Exact scope and exceptions: `docs/AUDIT.md`, `data/audit.json`, row-level `official_fact`/`flags`.
- 31 local tests pass: math kernels, true draw/push separation, odds boundaries, event IDs, withholding, source-link presence on table rows, 21-page static build and local links/fragments under `/Olbg8/`.
- Production pricing, calibration, complete official-history ingestion, event matching and prediction writing remain **needs review**, not done. No published picks and no fabricated lines. All gaps are on the site's Flagged for Review / Pricing pages.
- New public collector is fail-closed on robots.txt and access challenges. Sandbox attempt blocked at TLS; best-effort hosted discovery will be exercised after integration. It is not a daily prediction pipeline.
- Ownership scopes remain unchanged; integration by this session only. Repository branch is fixed by the platform, superseding requested session branch names.

## Concurrent-publication handoff
- Remote main advanced during this session with root dashboard owner `53f44a7c` and supplementary `arena-352da32b`. Read their combined task board on origin/main before integration. Preserve all their files byte-for-byte.
- This session relocates its distinct 116-entry inventory, field-scoped official corroboration, pricing kernels, tests, source audit and UI to **`evidence-lab/` only**, with uniquely named `.github/workflows/evidence-lab.yml` and `evidence-discovery.yml`. Root README, existing workflows and tooling are not owned by this session anymore.
- Request to root integration owner: optionally link `evidence-lab/index.html` from the root navigation after reviewing this supplementary scope; no root UI edits made by this session.
- Preserve current legacy main/root Pages configuration (another session recorded API update HTTP 403). Generated lab pages will be checked into evidence-lab/ and served under the existing site. Scheduled public discovery remains an artifact-only workflow; it does not commit to main or claim to refresh the public snapshot.

- Integration merge: add/add conflict in COORDINATION.md resolved by preserving the entire remote board and appending this session log. Root site and supplementary research-desk files remain unchanged.

### Urgent cross-scope review request to root owner / prediction session
- Remote main `4d52c4c` (PR #4) now has 75 recommendation rows: 44 marked string `False`, 31 string `True`. Dataset lacks probability, reproducible origination/calibration artifacts and claim-level official excerpts. Root `assets/app.js` renders a pick even for False rows. Generic directory links do not substantiate the match-specific statistics/injury prose. This is an audit finding of missing recorded support, not a claim that each factual statement has been disproved.
- **Task status: needs review** · root owner `53f44a7c` / prediction owner `arena/5bac89f3-olbg8` · scope `data/events.json`, `assets/app.js`, root navigation. Requested action: quarantine unsupported selections and require content evidence plus independent pricing before displaying confidence. This session will not edit these owned files. Review issue R13 is published in evidence-lab/review/index.html; immutable references are in evidence-lab/docs/AUDIT.md.
- Lab browser QA passed Chromium at 1440px and 390px: tabs, sport filters, event search, evidence disclosure, no JS page errors, no horizontal page overflow. Initial browser launch lacked libnspr4; resolved using Chromium package's bundled libraries. Browser tooling/screenshots remain ignored scratch files.

## Sources and verification

- OLBG hubs and event links were captured at `2026-10-26T05:18:26Z`; the primary dashboard has 116 in-scope rows after excluding one Hurling row.
- The official source register includes PGA TOUR, CEV, LNR Pro D2, ICC, WST, PDC, MLB, GAA, GBGB, ATP/WTA, F1, EHF, NHL, NBA, NRL/Super League, and EPCR links.
- Official pages checked for source-register and identity examples include MLB schedule/game centre, NHL schedule/game centres/standings, ICC fixtures, Formula 1 calendar, PGA TOUR schedule, LPGA tournaments, ATP scores, WTA tournaments/rankings, EHF Champions League matches, LNR Pro D2 calendar, CEV match centres, GAA fixtures/results, GBGB racing, WST matches, NBA games, NRL draw, and EPCR Champions Cup matches.
- `python3 scripts/test_site.py` passes: 21 HTML shells, 116 rows, and 15 sports. `python3 -m py_compile scripts/*.py` and `node --check assets/app.js` pass.

## Irregularities and flagged items

- The captured OLBG payload includes 116 rows, but only 101 have a nonblank event name and 17 have captured research lines. Blank values remain blank and are explained on **Flagged for Review**.
- Four rows have an event-specific official crosswalk. No row is treated as fully actionable without the complete publication gate; the primary **Picks** page therefore publishes zero recommendations.
- Four authored briefs (Milwaukee Brewers–Tampa Bay Rays, Los Angeles Kings–New York Rangers, Toronto Maple Leafs–Calgary Flames, and Detroit Red Wings–Edmonton Oilers) are retained as research notes and explicitly withheld from publication.
- Golf and Snooker have no OLBG listing in this capture; 13 sports have listings. The requested five-to-ten target is not fabricated where evidence is absent.
- Super League's fixture endpoint returned an official-site server error during capture. The stable Super League home page and NRL draw are linked and the limitation is flagged rather than hidden.
- The Gaelic Sports page uses the captured Gaelic Football category and excludes Hurling, which was explicitly out of scope.
- The legacy prediction artifacts from earlier repository work are not part of the primary navigation or publication payload; unsupported recommendations are not carried into the primary desk.

## Release log

- PR for predictions: https://github.com/karagemop466-tech/Olbg8/pull/4 merged on 2026-10-26.

- Session 7fbe3ee0 resolved this second coordination-only merge conflict by retaining both histories. Other root files preserved exactly. Claims in the preceding prediction-session log are that session’s claims, not this lab’s verification. See the urgent cross-scope audit request above.

## Expanded lab release checkpoint — 7fbe3ee0

| Task | Status | Owner | Final scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dated source audit, 116 observations and scoped official comparisons | done | 7fbe3ee0 | evidence-lab/data/, evidence-lab/docs/ |
| 21-page dashboard, filters, CSV and review queue | done | 7fbe3ee0 | evidence-lab/assets/, generated HTML |
| Math research kernels and fail-closed release tests | done | 7fbe3ee0 | evidence-lab/scripts/, evidence-lab/tests/ |
| Daily artifact-only public discovery | in progress | 7fbe3ee0 | .github/workflows/evidence-discovery.yml |
| Pricing all events, daily written picks, complete markets, autonomous official-history ingestion | needs review | unassigned | future production adapters; not implemented or claimed |
| Root unsupported recommendation quarantine request | needs review | root/prediction owners | cross-scope request only; public R13 |
| Integration / PR / legacy Pages confirmation | in progress | 7fbe3ee0 | COORDINATION.md, own evidence workflows |

- PR https://github.com/karagemop466-tech/Olbg8/pull/9 opened from the platform-fixed branch. Root and research-desk files preserved. Before merge: 31 tests and local 21-page link checks pass; browser checks passed desktop/mobile. Waiting only for automated quality results, not manual approval.
- GitHub Pages successfully deployed for PR #4: https://github.com/karagemop466-tech/Olbg8/actions/runs/40397819651

- 7fbe3ee0 integration refresh: concurrent publication-note append caused a coordination-only conflict; retained both additions without discarding any owned files.
- 2026-10-26: Built and committed the source-first primary dashboard. No unsupported recommendation is published.
- 2026-10-26: PR for earlier supplementary work #4 was merged and its Pages run was recorded by the concurrent integration: https://github.com/karagemop466-tech/Olbg8/actions/runs/40397819651
- 2026-10-26: Opened PR [#8](https://github.com/karagemop466-tech/Olbg8/pull/8) from `arena/40c30722-olbg8`; merge and Pages deployment status will be recorded here after release.

- 7fbe3ee0: PR #9 first merge attempt was rejected because PR #8 advanced main and appended the shared board. Re-integrated origin/main, preserving both coordination additions; no source-scope overlaps with evidence-lab.

## Publication result — expanded lab
- **PR #9 merged successfully** at 2026-10-26T20:44:52Z: https://github.com/karagemop466-tech/Olbg8/pull/9, merge `3d78b4eaf884580c4801b05c27c85ae50bb87626`.
- Required quality checks passed before merge. Legacy Pages build/deploy https://github.com/karagemop466-tech/Olbg8/actions/runs/40398383563 succeeded (build, report-build-status, deploy). Live lab and Flagged for Review pages were independently retrieved successfully through the page tool at https://karagemop466-tech.github.io/Olbg8/evidence-lab/ and https://karagemop466-tech.github.io/Olbg8/evidence-lab/review/index.html. Confirmed 116 observations, 15 categories, zero lab recommendations and source-linked review flags.
- Integration/PR/publication status: **done** for this lab, not for the full prediction service. Official-history ingestion, calibrated production prices, exhaustive markets and five original daily picks per sport remain **needs review** and disclosed on the live site.
- Manual dispatch of the discovery workflow returned HTTP 403 (integration lacks workflow-dispatch permission). No credentials requested or stored. Added a path-scoped push trigger on the required session branch to exercise the same artifact-only collector without modifying main or bypassing access controls.
- Main changed again via PR #8; R13 wording now explicitly refers to historical main `4d52c4c`, not an assertion that the later root UI still displays the same picks. Archived dataset support remains a review issue. No other owner's root files altered.
## Primary source-first release confirmation — `arena/40c30722-olbg8`

- Final primary dashboard release completed on 2026-10-26. The primary site contains 116 in-scope OLBG rows, 15 requested sports, 17 research lines, four event-confirmed rows, four withheld prose briefs, and zero published picks.
- PR [#8](https://github.com/karagemop466-tech/Olbg8/pull/8) merged to `main` as `14a98bd593a514849e3a22f2ae6618a46a2d2237`.
- Site quality passed in GitHub Actions run [40398243521](https://github.com/karagemop466-tech/Olbg8/actions/runs/40398243521). The root Pages workflow [40398243470](https://github.com/karagemop466-tech/Olbg8/actions/runs/40398243470) built and deployed successfully.
- GitHub Pages API reports `built` for the merge commit. Live URL: <https://karagemop466-tech.github.io/Olbg8/>. A cache-busted live fetch confirmed the 116-row source-first dashboard, 15 sport pages, zero published picks, and the four withheld briefs.

- Publication-log follow-up: preserved both appended coordination notes while integrating PR #10; conflict confined to shared task board.
- Hosted artifact-only discovery workflow executed successfully: https://github.com/karagemop466-tech/Olbg8/actions/runs/40398551331. This establishes the collector/build/artifact workflow runs, **not** that OLBG permitted access or all events were collected. Detailed artifact download from this sandbox failed because its external blob-storage host is outside allowed network access. No source-access outcome is inferred from green workflow status. Discovery runtime setup: done; complete source coverage: needs review.
- The separate custom Pages workflow https://github.com/karagemop466-tech/Olbg8/actions/runs/40398383974 also succeeded after PR #9. Lab/public review URLs were fetched successfully. Warnings were runner migration and action Node-runtime notices, not build failures.

## Session arena/438bbe65-olbg8 — full OLBG inventory, lines and written picks

Session ID: `438bbe65`. Branch: `arena/438bbe65-olbg8` (platform-required name; the requested `session-<id>/<task>` form is overridden by the platform's fixed branch).

| Task | Status | Owner | File scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| OLBG reverse-engineering: `__data.json` hydration feed decoder for all 16 category hubs | in progress | 438bbe65 | `scripts/collect_olbg.py`, `.github/workflows/olbg-collect.yml`, `data/olbg/*` |
| Official-source collector (league APIs/feeds) for every covered sport | in progress | 438bbe65 | `scripts/collect_official.py`, `data/official/*` |
| Line origination (win/handicap/total/outright) and confidence grading | in progress | 438bbe65 | `scripts/originate.py`, `data/lines/*` |
| Written predictions (>=30 words, unique, official-source facts) | in progress | 438bbe65 | `data/predictions/*`, `content/` |
| Primary dashboard rebuild + Flagged for Review + release | in progress | 438bbe65 | `index.html`, `assets/`, `sports/`, `data/dashboard.json`, `scripts/build_dashboard.py`, `scripts/test_site.py` |

Notes for parallel sessions:
- `evidence-lab/` and `research-desk/` are treated as read-only archives by this session; nothing in them is modified.
- Root dashboard files are being rebuilt by this session as the integration owner. If another session needs to change `index.html`, `assets/`, `sports/` or `data/dashboard.json`, log the request here rather than editing.
- Outbound network from the agent sandbox is restricted to GitHub/npm/PyPI. OLBG and official league APIs are therefore fetched by GitHub Actions runners (`olbg-collect.yml`) and committed as JSON artifacts, which this session then verifies.
- No event, price, statistic, injury or prediction is invented. Anything that cannot be confirmed from a named source stays blank and is published on Flagged for Review.
